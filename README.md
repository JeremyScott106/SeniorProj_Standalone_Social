The goal of this project was to create a stand alone version of social media similar to Reddit.com

I took lead in this project and I am very happy with what we managed to accomplish as a team in just a few months.

It is easy to notice in the User Interface, a lot of different options were taken on different screens.  This is the main thing I want to change when I finally have time to refactor this code.  I started out using one technique, but as I learned JFrame, I chose other routes to complete the task.

Please feel free to poke around and let me know what you think.
